## Program Design Research Proposal in PDFs
This research proposal aims to explore new approaches to program design, with a focus on improving the clarity, modularity, and maintainability of software. The proposed research will involve a combination of literature review, case studies, and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different design techniques.

## Background
Program design is a crucial aspect of software development, as it determines the structure and organization of code, and influences its readability, reuse, and evolution. However, program design is also a challenging and complex task, as it must balance competing concerns such as simplicity, performance, and scalability. Moreover, the field of program design is constantly evolving, with new techniques and tools emerging all the time.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this research proposal are to:

Conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature on program design, including both classical and contemporary approaches.
Identify and analyze key challenges and opportunities in program design, and develop a set of research questions to guide the subsequent work.
Conduct case studies and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different design techniques in real-world scenarios.
Synthesize the findings from the literature review, case studies, and experiments, and develop a set of best practices and guidelines for program design.

## Methodology
The research will be conducted in four main stages:

Literature review: This stage will involve a systematic search and analysis of the existing literature on program design. The review will cover both classical approaches, such as modularity and separation of concerns, and contemporary techniques, such as object-oriented design and functional programming. The aim of the literature review is to identify common themes, challenges, and opportunities in program design.

Research questions: Based on the findings from the literature review, this stage will involve the development of a set of research questions to guide the subsequent work. The research questions will be focused on specific aspects of program design, such as modularity, maintainability, and readability.

Case studies and experiments: This stage will involve the conduct of case studies and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different design techniques in real-world scenarios. The case studies will involve the analysis of existing software systems, while the experiments will involve the design and implementation of small programs using different techniques.

Synthesis and guidelines: This final stage will involve the synthesis of the findings from the literature review, case studies, and experiments, and the development of a set of best practices and guidelines for program design. The guidelines will be based on the research questions, and will provide practical advice and recommendations for software developers.

## Expected outcomes
The expected outcomes of this research proposal are:

A comprehensive review of the existing literature on program design.
A set of research questions to guide the subsequent work.
A set of case studies and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different design techniques.
A set of best practices and guidelines for program design.
 
##Conclusion
This research proposal outlines a plan to explore new approaches to program design, with a focus on improving the clarity, modularity, and maintainability of software. By conducting a literature review, case studies, and experiments, the proposed research will provide valuable insights and recommendations for software developers
